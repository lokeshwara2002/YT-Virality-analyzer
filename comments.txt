1. “My brother has a…” <br>“A sister” We’re talking about animals humans eat 😂

2. For those confused, this list is ordered by number of animals slaughtered every year. A single cow feeds a lot of people, while a single person can eat many sardines or shrimp in a single seating, so it’s not really a popularity issue

3. Lmao my brother has a........ sister 😂😂😂😂😂

4. We are eating sisters out here? Damn that means I ain&#39;t safe 😅😂

5. <b>&quot;9... this one you&#39;re not gonna like&quot;</b><br>Me : <b>&quot;DOG!&quot;</b>

23. Sister 😂😂😂😅 you gotta love these guys

24. As an italian I can fully confirm that in almost every restaurant of the country we have the octopus😂

25. I&#39;ve had rabbit, it&#39;s pretty good. It&#39;s like 90% like chicken. Just a little bit more gamey of a flavor.

26. The U.S consumes over 12 million tons of beef last year while only 350,000 tons of octopus were eaten last year worldwide.

27. Octopus is on here but cows aren&#39;t? Tf

28. Remember, you have almost a billion people who don’t eat beef in India. Plus, a lot of third world countries find beef to be more expensive or inaccessible as chicken

29. Great short bro

30. A sister 😂 most Alabama answer ever 😅

31. What about lamb? Nobody eats mutton chops?

32. bro said it so confident 😂 “ a sister “

33. Horses and sister got me 😂😂

34. I felt that &quot;Jesus&quot;😅😅😅

35. I’d like to see the list adjusted to per unit of weight. Wait let me ask ChatGPT. Here’s the answer:<br><br>When looking at the most consumed animals by humans based on weight, the list generally includes larger animals that provide more meat per unit. Here&#39;s a general list:<br><br>1. **Cattle (Beef)**: Cattle are the most consumed animals in terms of weight due to their large size and the global popularity of beef.<br>2. **Pigs (Pork)**: Pigs are also high on the list because of their size and the extensive use of pork in many cuisines.<br>3. **Chicken**: Chickens are among the most commonly eaten, especially since poultry is a staple in many diets worldwide.<br>4. **Sheep (Lamb/Mutton)**: Sheep provide a substantial amount of meat and are commonly consumed in various regions.<br>5. **Goats**: Goat meat, or &quot;chevon,&quot; is popular in many parts of the world and provides a good amount of meat per animal.<br>6. **Turkeys**: Turkeys, particularly in North America and some parts of Europe, are consumed in large quantities.<br>7. **Fish (Various species like Salmon, Tuna, Cod, etc.)**: Different fish species are consumed heavily by weight, particularly in countries with strong seafood traditions.<br>8. **Camels**: In some parts of the Middle East and Africa, camels are raised for their meat, which is consumed relatively per unit weight.<br>9. **Buffalo**: In countries like India, buffalo meat (often called carabeef) is widely consumed.<br>10. **Deer (Venison)**: While less common globally, deer are a significant source of meat in some regions, especially where hunting is popular.<br><br>This list is approximate and can vary depending on regional preferences, dietary habits, and the availability of these animals in different parts of the world.<br><br>You’re welcome 🤗

36. Dang he forgot what game he was playing at the end😂

37. I&#39;m surprise lamb is not on the list.

38. “Stay away from from fish” “yes sardines”

39. My region has many lakes and long forrests, so we often eat fish, ducks and gooses but daily we eat pigs, chickens and some wild meat.

40. &quot;Think worldwide.&quot;<br>Me: DOG!

41. People asking why Cow 🐄 is not in the list, main reason is that 1 cow gives you approx over 800+ meals, whilst 1 Chicken 🐓 gives you around 5 meals.. So you only need to kill 1 cow to feed 800 humans, but 160 Chickens to feed the same amount 😮😅. Simplez 😉

42. This should be redone based on weight instead of raw units

43. &quot;A sister&quot;<br><br>No, we&#39;re not talking about Alabama

44. Goat be like are you kidding me

45. Man really just said his sister is among the most eaten things :&#39;) That&#39;s a next degree violation :&#39;)

46. Who eats a rabbit and where is cow

47. I remember people using a lot of sardines for fish sauce and broth, including pasta

48. The fact that cows are not in the list is both concerning and relieving at the same time

49. Omg he killed with the sister response 😂😂😂😂

50. Crazy how evolution works all those animals  are easy prey amazing how we develop a taste for things that are easy to catch

51. “Think about fried Italian appetiser”<br>Me : Calamari(squid)!❌<br>Him : Octopus! ✅<br>🤷‍♀️

52. Bro took out the data right from his ass 😂

53. Chicken: I don&#39;t want to number one here😅

54. I&#39;m mediterranean and our family eats about half the sardines of the entire world. My dad goes through 1 kilo per sitting so sardines coming in second is to be expected 😅

55. Thank God i am veggy by birth... PROUD TO BE 🕉️ ... HARE SRINIVASA 🙏🙏🙏🥰🥰🇮🇳😅🇮🇳🇮🇳

56. Messi and Ronaldo are eaten the most in asian 😂

57. The list you received doesn’t accurately reflect the global consumption of animals based on common metrics like production volume and consumption rates. Here&#39;s why:<br><br>1. **Chicken**: It&#39;s correct that chicken is the most consumed meat worldwide.<br>  <br>2. **Sardines**: While sardines are popular, they aren&#39;t individually among the top consumed animals. &quot;Fish&quot; in general is consumed heavily, but sardines alone wouldn&#39;t rank second.<br><br>3. **Shrimp**: Shrimp is very popular globally, especially in Asia and the Americas, but it wouldn’t rank this high compared to other meats like pork or beef.<br><br>4. **Duck**: Duck is commonly eaten, particularly in Asia, but it isn&#39;t consumed as widely as pork or beef.<br><br>5. **Goose**: Goose is much less commonly consumed than other animals like cattle, pigs, and even goats.<br><br>6. **Oysters**: Oysters are popular in certain regions, but they are more of a delicacy and not consumed on the same scale as meats like chicken, pork, or beef.<br><br>7. **Octopus**: Octopus is another seafood that&#39;s enjoyed in specific cultures, but its global consumption is relatively low.<br><br>8. **Pig**: Pork is one of the most consumed meats worldwide and would typically rank higher, often in the top 2 or 3.<br><br>9. **Rabbit**: Rabbit is consumed in specific regions, but again, it wouldn&#39;t rank as high as major meat sources like pork or beef.<br><br>10. **Tuna**: Tuna is widely consumed, particularly in canned form, but it wouldn’t necessarily rank higher than major land-based meats.<br><br>In summary, the correct order of global meat consumption generally places <b>*chicken, pork, and beef*</b> at the top, with fish also being significant when considering the entire category rather than specific species. The list you received seems more like a mixture of globally popular animals but doesn&#39;t reflect actual global consumption volumes.

58. 1)Lamb<br>2)Chicken<br>3)Pork<br>4)fish<br>5)mutton<br>6)duck

59. shrimp, is the kitchen bug, of the sea, for those who don&#39;t know (cockroach) good appetite!<br><br>Rabbit is the best!

60. i hate to admit but these numbers are correct if you go by number of animals cuz sardines and shrimps and octopus can come as many different species and sizes. for those thinking beef well one cow can feed 3000~10000 people or more

72. Half of those are consumed regularly in Jamaica.

73. Where’s cows? All those burgers!

74. Tbf the only reason cow isnt in the list, is because the list counts per animals and not per weight. Cow is easily top 3

75. Cow is not here because around 1 billion people don&#39;t eat it and it is expensive in other countries for normal people to eat it

76. &quot;My brother has a...&quot; <br><br>&quot;A sister...&quot; <br><br>And I screamed COW! 😅

124. Damn, octupus are so smart though<br><br>Really good poached then deep fried too

125. &quot;Stay away from fish&quot; ... &quot;Sardines are number 2&quot;
