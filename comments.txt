1. “My brother has a…” <br>“A sister” We’re talking about animals humans eat 😂

2. For those confused, this list is ordered by number of animals slaughtered every year. A single cow feeds a lot of people, while a single person can eat many sardines or shrimp in a single seating, so it’s not really a popularity issue

22. The U.S consumes over 12 million tons of beef last year while only 350,000 tons of octopus were eaten last year worldwide.

23. Remember, you have almost a billion people who don’t eat beef in India. Plus, a lot of third world countries find beef to be more expensive or inaccessible as chicken

40. *duck noises<br><br>Rick ross: chicken is already off the board.

41. &quot;A sister&quot;<br><br>No, we&#39;re not talking about Alabama

42. People asking why Cow 🐄 is not in the list, main reason is that 1 cow gives you approx over 800+ meals, whilst 1 Chicken 🐓 gives you around 5 meals.. So you only need to kill 1 cow to feed 800 humans, but 160 Chickens to feed the same amount 😮😅. Simplez 😉

43. This should be redone based on weight instead of raw units
