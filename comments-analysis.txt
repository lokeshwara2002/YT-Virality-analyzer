Summary of Comments (What the video is about):
Pork is the most widely eaten meat in the world (36%) followed by poultry (33%), beef (24%), and goats/sheep (5) Lamb, Goat, sheep are the happiest 10. Never expected joke in this serious conversation. The U.S. consumes over 12 million tons of beef. Only 350,000 tons of octopus were eaten last year worldwide. Almost a billion people don't eat beef in India. 1 cow gives you approx over 800+ meals, whilst 1 Chicken gives you around 5 meals. You only need to kill 1 cow to feed 800 humans, but 160 Chickens to feed the same amount. This should be redone based on weight instead of raw units. Ister is among the most eaten things :&#39;s a next degree violation. Thank God i am veggy by birth... PROUD TO BE ... HARE SRINIVASA.
