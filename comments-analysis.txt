Summary of Comments (What the video is about):
A single cow feeds a lot of people, while a single person can eat many sardines or shrimp in a single seating. Pork is the most widely eaten meat in the world. Lamb, Goat, sheep are the happiest. The U.S. consumes over 12 million tons of beef last year while only 350,000 tons of octopus were eaten last year worldwide. Octopus is on here but cows aren&#39;t? When looking at the most consumed animals by humans based on weight, the list generally includes larger animals that provide more meat per unit. Here&#39;s a general list: **Cattle (Beef)**. **Pigs (Pork)**: Pigs are also high on the list because of their size. This list is approximate and can vary depending on regional preferences, dietary habits, and the availability of these animals in different parts of the world. In India, buffalo meat (often called carabeef) is widely consumed. 1 cow gives you approx over 800+ meals, whilst 1 Chicken gives you around 5 meals. So you only need to kill 1 cow to feed 800 humans, but 160 Chickens to feed the same amount. The list doesn't accurately reflect the global consumption of animals based on common metrics like production volume and consumption rates. Messi and Ronaldo are eaten the most in asian. While sardines are popular, they aren&#39;t individually among the top consumed animals. Shrimp is very popular globally, especially in Asia and the Americas, but it wouldn’t rank this high compared to other meats. The correct order of global meat consumption generally places <b>*chicken, pork, and beef* at the top, with fish also being significant when considering the entire category rather than specific species. The list you received seems more like a mixture of globally popular animals but doesn&#39;t reflect actual global consumption volumes. One cow can feed 3000~10000 people or more 61. Dudes sister is the 9th most eaten animal on the planet apparently 62. my brother has a...... SISTER HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA 63. Holy Cow to the guy who told &quot;Cow&quot ;... 64.

Pork comes first followed by chicken then beef. Rabbit and dogs are best. The Peruvians eats pigeons. Guinea pig, nutria, iguana… Mostly south east Asia and South America. Tuna chicken and beef are the top 3 in Australia, I’m pretty surr 93. You should try grilled crocodile meat. No11 is DOG..WE TALKING WORLDWIDE. If this was a De Zerbi Brighton, it could have been more. Brighton were so poor against us and this why some fans feel like United has improved. United has not improved, it&#39;s just that Brighton were not the same as the Brighton under de Zerbi. This list is in terms of how many animals are eaten, rather than the volume of food eaten. This list is based on actual tonnage and not on the number of animals or fish. A single
